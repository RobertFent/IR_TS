Now we can say that the innovation of the Internet has transformed this “globalized village” into a “cyberspace world,” where everything is at our disposal at just the click of the mouse. \n \nFrom food to running a global enterprise, all things now are available at your doorstep. Computer literacy and Internet savvy have become indispensable in every field, and those who do not know how to operate a computer are considered illiterate. Currently, with a lot of business being conducted online, a different method of promotion is needed, and that is where social media marketing comes into play. \n \nSocial media has been cordially welcomed by the world and businesses simultaneously. The Internet is considered the fastest way to get linked with customers; social media also paves the way for emerging entrepreneurs that want to try their luck by starting businesses online. \n \nAs every story has two versions, it’s a similar case with the Internet and social media; people who engage in such activities have noticed that this very medium, social media, is the element that can make or break them. One of the reasons that people avoid starting online businesses is that they don’t feel competent enough with social media to use it successfully as a marketing tool. \n Social Media Is Faster  \nAd posting and changing can be done at a faster pace with social media as compared to placing ads on billboards or in magazines. With the aid of social media, a business’s reach also becomes wider, as social media doesn’t have geographical limits. Both of these features have made many marketing mediums obsolete. \n \nSocial media can expand a business in several ways: through ad postings on Facebook and other social sites, pictures on Instagram, tweets on Twitter. All are poised for customer engagement. Jeev Trika of TopSEOs.com says, “The same goals are achieved as those through conventional marketing methods, but at a relatively smaller cost.” \n Social Media Is Economical  \nPromotion through social media is an economical yet prolific way to expand business. People who have ventured into social media marketing stand witness to the aftermaths of this method, reason being that social media uses these five key elements of marketing: listening, marketing, funding, service and profits. \n \nThe basic marketing skills that marketers learn in college are perfectly matched with social media marketing. Social media followers come pouring in to those businesses that use social media marketing, as they feel like they are wanted and their queries are of great importance. \n Social Media Is Necessary  \nSocial media marketing is not harmful to your company. In fact, not using social media as a marketing medium is a disadvantage. Thus, the number of businesses that have not adopted social media marketing is very low. Those that opt out are excluding huge profit centers and limiting their reach. Even if a business is targeting a niche, by not using social media marketing, it not only ignores that niche, but also a large chunk of potential customers. \n \nIf you haven’t jumped on the social media marketing bandwagon, then you must get on board before it’s too late. Not all businesses have huge marketing budgets, or even the resources of marketing staff. Businesses that market themselves can use social media as one of the weapons in their arsenal of marketing tactics , and find that a lucrative company is just around the corner. \n \nThe post How Social Media Marketing Can Make or Break Your Business appeared first on AllBusiness.com .","title":"How Social Media Marketing Can Make or Break Your Business","media-type":"Blog","source":"AllBusiness.com","published":"2015-09-25T22:05:06Z"},{"id":"b06bdf2d-6ead-4449-a0f5-861785471dc3","content":"Social media marketing makes a lot more people successful in today's society.

You have made it your business to learn what you need to know in order to make social media work for you. However, you find that it isn’t enough. What do you need to do? \n \n\n Leveraging social media properly for your business  \nThere are some differences in the approach that you need to take with social media if you have a small business. Social media channels and the way that you work them are not a “one size fits all” situation. The social media channels that you choose and the way that you leverage those channels for the desired impact are bound to be different in your case than in other business owner’s experiences. One thing that you should always remember is that social media will work for you. You just need to figure out how to make it work in the most effective way possible. \n \nIn theory, you may believe that social media is an important marketing tool and that you should take advantage of it in the best way possible. However, without any deep understanding of how to make it work for you and your business, you won’t get very far. If you don’t get very far, you won’t be able to achieve the results that you are looking for. \n \nBefore you can get involved with social media in any way, you must make sure that your social media marketing strategy is solid and that you understand exactly where you are going with it. Once you have done that, you can look at what you are doing and identify what you are doing right and what you need to adjust in order to achieve more favorable results. \n \nYou may be doing (or not doing) certain things and not be aware of what those are. If you haven’t identified them, you can’t fix them. \n   \nQuality versus quantity:  The concept of quality over quantity is a very important one. If you collect 10,000 fans and followers but you only interact with 50 of those fans and followers, what are you actually gaining by having 10,000? You wouldn’t know the remaining fans and followers if they passed you on the street. So, what value do they actually hold for you? You are much better off concentrating on the quality of your connections and by ensuring that those interactions cause your relationships to advance. \n \nIt is very important for you to bear in mind that if you truly want your relationships to progress, you must make the effort to interact with those people. You can comment on what they are saying, ask questions, ask for their opinions, ask them to suggest topics for your content, etc. Another thing that is very important is to tell your story. That is how you will be able to connect with the other person on a personal/emotional level. If you appeal to their feelings, they will react to you and will want to continue to interact with you on a deeper level.  \n   \nDon’t forget about the analytics:  Gathering metrics from your social media interactions may seem like a mundane, waste of time; however, it may be more important than you realize. If you pay attention to metrics, you will learn about what you are doing correctly and what just isn’t working for you. If you can identify what isn’t working, you can fix those particular aspects of your social media marketing efforts. \n \nKnowledge certainly is power in this case. One of the most important aspects of your social media marketing efforts is not only that you interact but also the way that you interact. You will want to interact as effectively as you can and your will need to commit to dedicating a consistent amount of time and effort to your social media marketing strategy each week. You will see that it will pay off. However, remember that it may take a little time for you to see results. Just don’t forget that you will achieve those results. You need to have a little patience. \n   \nShow other people what you and your business are worth:  When it comes to interacting through social media online, you are building relationships with other people. \n The basis of any meaningful relationship must be trust, credibility, and expertise. Tweet This  \nWithout those qualities, you will not be able to truly connect with the other person. Part of that is the idea that the other person needs to understand why it is worth their while to interact with you. If you can’t show them (prove to them) why they should connect with you (and continue to connect with you), the relationship will not go any further. This all goes back to the WIIFM (What’s In It For Me?) concept. In other words, the only thing that the other person is interested in is if you have the ability to solve his or her problems. Also, remember to keep your communications clear, concise, and to the point. The other person will appreciate it tremendously. \n   \nDon’t squelch your uniqueness: Periodically, it is important for you to examine your chosen social media channels. What may have made sense in the beginning may not make sense anymore. If you come to that conclusion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with removing some channels and replacing them with others that work better for you and your business. \n \nAs you are scrutinizing your social media profiles, you must make sure to look at every single aspect of those profiles. The chances are great that you will find something to tweak that will ultimately make a difference. Refreshing what you have is generally an effective thing to do. \n   \nRecognizing that your social media marketing strategy is yours alone:  It is never a good idea to assume that your social media marketing strategy is a round peg that fits in a round hole. That will never be the case. Your social media marketing strategy is unique to your business and it is your uniqueness that will ultimately want people to buy what you are selling. If you offer products and/or services that other people can obtain anywhere at any time, what do they need you for? Chances are great that another person can sell what seems like the same thing that you are offering for less money. Remember, though, that it only seems like that on the surface. It is your job to make them understand why your offerings are better. \n   Conclusion  \nYou may not realize that you are missing out on some amazing social media marketing opportunities. It is important to become acutely aware of what you are doing and to make sure that you identify and fix what is not working. When it comes to working social media for your small business, you can make an equal impact as larger businesses. You just need to figure out how to do that effectively. It is also important to remember that just because you may have limited resources, it doesn’t mean that you can’t make a big splash! You certainly can. That is the only way that you are going to allow your business to go forward. Standing still is the same as going backward. \n \nWe are pleased to provide you with the insightful comments contained herein.

And revelations that French prosecutors are investigating pharmacists in Toulon, after being alerted by the country's anti-doping agency, emerged in the week that France left for their World Cup base in England. \n\nThe problem has also been acknowledged in the tournament's host country. \n\nWorld Cup blood and urine tests are to be carried out by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD). It has refused to say how many tests will be carried out but it knows rugby well. \n\nOf the 47 people on the UKAD banned list 16 are from rugby union and another 12 from rugby league. \n\nMany of those banned in Britain and other rugby powers are still young. In New Zealand, Finn Hart-Strawbridge, 19, a former young New Zealand Barbarian, was banned for two years after admitting buying a banned substance on the internet. \n\nHis lawyer said Hart-Strawbridge bought the human growth hormone precursor GHRP-6 as a \"joke.\" \n\nBut many coaches and experts say there is intense pressure on young players to bulk up in a sport that often relies on brute force to get the tactical advantage that is the beauty of rugby. \n\nWorld Rugby president Lapasset has called doping \"the biggest danger for the integrity of the sport.\" \n\n\"Even if we are convinced that there is no culture of systematic doping in rugby, you have to be intransigent and World Rugby acts with a principle of zero tolerance,\" he added. \n\nTests during the World Cup will be examined at the elite Kings College in London and then held for eight years for possible new tests.  Rugby has introduced biological passports that have helped catch more cheats in other sports by keeping records over several years for comparison. \n\nIn 2014, more than 2,000 tests were carried around the world out and four players banned. \n\nComing into the World Cup, France's squad were tested three times by the country's ALDA agency. Ten players were awoken at 7:00am three days before France played England in a warmup match last month. \n\nLater came the media reports that a Toulon pharmacist may have provided steroids to players at the southern city's three time European champions. \n\nToulon president Mourad Boudjellal has angrily condemned the media claims and said it was a social security fraud with no link to the club. \n\nDoping has been a sensitive topic in France since former international Laurent Benezech alleged that banned substances were widespread in the national team in the 1980s. Benezech claimed he was given a steroid at the 1995 World Cup. He was sued for defamation by the players union but a French court cleared the former prop. \n\n\"We know we are in a high risk sport,\" said Christian Bagate, who heads the French Rugby Federation's anti-doping effort. \"The public has the right to doubt that our players are clean and unfortunately you can find supplements that have doping products on sale in supermarket.\" \n\nBut the doctor insisted that contradictory World Anti-Doping Agency rules did not help and said the cases are individuals rather than organised on a team level. \n\nUKAD chief executive Nicole Sapstead agrees but has highlighted the need for tests ahead of major tournaments like the World Cup. \"The last thing any huge tournament like this wants is a doping scandal,\" she said.","title":"Doping doubts cast shadow over Rugby World Cup","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!Xtra","published":"2015-09-15T02:42:08Z"},{"id":"226c2c5e-020f-452c-8aba-446474f9e1bb","content":"Clarifying the situation after the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) excluded Johan Bruyneel from its list of banned support personnel, the US Anti Doping Agency (USADA) has said that the Belgian’s previous sanction remains. \n \nSpeaking to CyclingTips, USADA’s Communications Manager Annie Skinner said that his absence from the WADA list doesn’t mean he can currently work with athletes. \n \n“The WADA list states it won’t include those who are appealing their decision. Given that Mr. Bruyneel is appealing his case, that is why it isn’t included on that list,” she stated. \n \n“He is still banned from sport, and as such is also prohibited from associating with athletes.” \n \nBruyneel was the general manager of the US Postal Service team and was accused of a range of doping practises by the US Anti Doping Agency. He requested an arbitration hearing, but was found guilty in April 2014 and handed a ten year ban. \n \nUnder the terms of this ban athletes are forbidden from working with him. He is also unable to work in any sporting context. \n \nHe appealed this sanction to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and was due to be heard on March 2. CAS has not published a result, and has not responded to recent requests for clarification . \n \nEarlier this month WADA published a list of 114 names from a range of sports who are forbidden from working with athletes. \n \nThis includes Dr Michele Ferrari, Luis Garcia del Moral, Geert Leinders, Maurice Duquette, Carlo Santuccione, Mariano Piccoli, Bruno Leali and Guido Nigrelli, who all had past involvement in cycling and were implicated in doping practices. All bar Piccoli have been given lifetime bans. \n \nBruyneel was missing, as was the doctor Eufemiano Fuentes. The latter is currently appealing his own Spanish judicial case. \n \nUSADA’s clarification assuages concerns that the duos’ appeals meant that cyclists and others could use their services pending a final decision. \n \nAlso see: Confusion over status of Johan Bruyneel and Eufemiano Fuentes in relation to sporting bans","title":"USADA clarifies Bruyneel status: Belgian remains banned despite absence from WADA list","media-type":"Blog","source":"Cycling Tips","published":"2015-09-26T19:52:07Z"},{"id":"981cc306-db4e-48e9-93e0-91dc11f500c2","content":"Kylie Palmer of Australia competes during the women's 200m freestyle heats at the 14th FINA World Championships in Shanghai July 26, 2011.

I'm confident we can go forward even more strongly.\" \n\nCookson also said the anti-doping measures undertaken by the UCI have brought \"the best credibility\" with the World Anti-Doping Agency. \n\nCookson has been tasked with restructuring the sport to the needs of athletes, teams, race organizers and sponsors after the scandal. \n\n\"The economics are challenging. There's no question about that,\" Cookson said. \n\n\"We've reached a balanced situation that recognizes the history and traditions of our sport while at the same time recognizes the need for evolution. We want to preserve what's beautiful about our sport around the world.\" \n\nCookson said the biggest changes the UCI management committee took at Richmond were to sort out the men's schedule and to start the Women's Tour as a revamp of the past World Cup series. \n\n\"What we're seeing is an evolution not a revolution,\" Cookson said. \"It's not a big bang solution, but it's one that will allow sustainable development. It's less risky.\" \n\nAsked about eventual parity between men's and women's offerings, a potential Women's Tour de France, Cookson warned progress would come in measured steps as the market dictates. \n\n\"We can't flick a switch and change the world overnight,\" he said. \"We've got to let the women's calendar evolve.

Myself and Jo, we felt comfortable. But it depends on who you are and how comfortable you are.

You don't want  all these things shrouded in secrecy and to that extent it should be  encouraged. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n''But I can only speak for myself.

EDE provides business decision-makers with meaningful value from their event attendee data that they can use to quickly adjust and optimize their exhibits and displays. \n  \n\"The data captured when monitoring consumer behavior at events such as attendee visits, dwell times, and return visits, is much more impactful for event organizers when it is distilled and presented visually,\" said Kurt Sabin, Director of Business Development for Event Guidance. \"Converting the data into easily understood business intelligence has traditionally occurred days after a show concludes, when the data is culled, interpreted and properly presented. The ability to make timely decisions is limited by the data and when it is available.\" \n   \nSabin added, \"Express Data Export analyzes live behavior data, generating clear, concise reports in seconds. The data visualization can happen anytime during an event, so that decision-makers can read and react confidently with data-based decisions to increase their return on investment.\" \n\nEvent Guidance teamed with a leading software company to create EDE, and believes it provides brands a strong competitive advantage. \n\n\"The faster event managers know what is attracting interest -- and what is not -- the sooner they can reallocate or exchange assets to maximize engagement,\" said Sabin. \"They no longer need to wait until the event is over, or until a tour is over. EDE eliminates the time lag that has been a drag on the value of capturing behavioral data at events.\" \n\nEDE works seamlessly with Event Guidance's tiered technology offerings, Proximity Trace and Proximity Frame, which capture consumer behavior by monitoring attendees' smartphones using WiFi. Event Guidance software analyzes the data and presents the results on dashboards providing more than 20 metrics that clients can share with decision-makers worldwide. EDE makes this data visualization process near real-time. \n\nEvent Guidance will be a featured speaker at the 2015 EVENTtech Conference, sponsored by Event Marketer, November 2-4, 2015 in Las Vegas.

Just look at the unbelievable turbulence in Bitcoin prices — the currency’s value shot up 6,000% in one year before collapsing in value — and the alleged fraud at the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange that led many investors to lose money. \n\nIn theory, an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that mirrors the price of Bitcoin would offer a somewhat safer alternative. Think: something akin to SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which tracks gold prices. \n\nBut no Bitcoin ETFs have been created. An effort by the twins Cameron and Tyle Winklevoss to do just that has been waiting two years to receive approval from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission is still trying to figure out how to define and oversee Bitcoin. \n\nThis week, ARK Investment Management announced a full embrace of the digital currency. Its ARK Web x.0 ETF became the first ETF to invest in bitcoins. \n\n“Current prices present an attractive entry point for our investors,” Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and chief investment officer, said in a statement. \n\nBut before taking a leap, it would be smart to read the fine print of the ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol “ARKW.” \n\nFirst, it’s not a pure play on Bitcoin. Even though it announced the Bitcoin play, the ETF is actually an investment in what it calls disruptive technologies. The crypto currency represents just a slice of its holdings, packaged along with Netflix, LinkedIn and athenahealth, a cloud-based provider of electronic health records. \n\nSecond, the ARK ETF is not actually investing directly in bitcoins. It’s buying shares of something called the Bitcoin Investment Trust. Most people haven’t even heard of that. \n\nThat trust started trading in May on the pink sheets under the ticker symbol “GBTC.” It’s got a market valuation of under $40 million and very little trading volume. \n\nThe pink sheets, also known as the over-the-counter market, provide less transparency and oversight from regulators. They’re like a Wild West alternative to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. \n\n“Pink sheets are where most investors aren’t willing to tread,” said Matt Hougan, CEO of ETF.com, a research firm. \n\nGrayScale, which sponsored the Bitcoin trust, defended the decision to list on the pink sheets and noted that a number of major foreign companies such as Adidas and Roche list their U.S. shares there. \n\nAnother problem is that the investment hasn’t really mirrored the price of Bitcoin, which defeats the purpose. At times the trust’s shares have spiked or surged — even though underlying Bitcoin prices were relatively calm. \n\n“You’re not really getting Bitcoin here. You’re getting a Bitcoin derivative that kind of tracks the price of Bitcoin — but not really well,” said Hougan. “There are a bunch of leaps of faith in that chain of command.” \n\nThe ETF company brushed away these concerns, suggesting that price volatility is actually a good sign. \n\nAnother risk for the investment is regulatory. The trust warns investors in disclosure documents that its future may be jeopardized by looming regulation from the SEC. \n\nAll of this is on top of the inherent risk that goes into investing in anything that has volatility of Bitcoin. \n\nFounded in 2009, Bitcoin burst onto the financial scene this decade as investors looked for an alternative to traditional currencies. Prices skyrocketed more than 6,000% in 2013 before peaking at nearly $1,250. \n\nAnd then prices collapsed, losing two-thirds of their value last year alone. While Bitcoin has actually calmed down a lot lately, it’s still down 27% this year to $230 apiece.","title":"There’s a new way to invest in Bitcoin — But buyer beware","media-type":"News","source":"KCMO Talk Radio","published":"2015-09-18T15:53:58Z"},{"id":"5404e1fe-0f86-42f0-a5f2-e4cf060addd4","content":"LAS VEGAS \n\nThe Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATMs will provide consumers with the ability to instantaneously purchase bitcoin through their mobile devices.

The new integration allows CardCash customers to buy discounted gift cards with bitcoin, expands bitcoin user purchasing power to include more than 1,100 national and regional retailers, and brings the prepaid card industry and bitcoin closer together. \n \nCardCash buys unwanted gift cards and then sells them at discounts up to 35% less than face value. Through this partnership with BitPay, customers can pay for their gift cards with bitcoin and shop at over 1,100 of the largest national and regional retailers, including Walmart, Delta Airlines, Macy’s, and Shell. Approximately 70% of gift cards on CardCash.com are e-cards, meaning most purchasers will receive their redeemable code in 30 minutes or less. \n \nGift cards make up a large percentage of overall bitcoin sales because they bridge the gap between bitcoin users and many major brands that do not yet accept bitcoin payments directly. Additionally, the significant savings offered by CardCash is expected to boost the success of this partnership to new heights. \n \nBitcoin, a pioneering digital payments currency, minimizes the risk of fraud and chargebacks through its use of secure cryptography. Similarly, CardCash has pioneered the current compliance and security standards for secondary gift card retailers. By now accepting bitcoin payments, CardCash will further improve customer security and reduce exposure to fraud. \n \n“BitPay has developed a sophisticated bitcoin payment processing platform, which meets CardCash’s industry-leading compliance and security standards,” said Elliot Bohm, CEO of CardCash. “We continually look for ways to improve our customers’ shopping experience, and bitcoin helps ensure the fastest and most secure transactions possible.” \n \n\"Gift cards are one of the more popular categories of bitcoin sales we process” said Sony Singh, Chief Commercial Officer at BitPay. “We expect this partnership to expand on the success of Bitcoin in the prepaid card space, especially given CardCash’s substantial incentives and savings.” \n \nAbout CardCash \n \nFounded in 2008, CardCash offers the country’s largest and most secure selection of discounted gift cards online. The company has been ranked for three straight years on Forbes’ list of America’s Most Promising Companies, and for four straight years on the prestigious Inc. 500 list of the fastest growing private companies in America. \n \nCardCash raised $6 million in equity funding from Guggenheim Partners in November 2013, and $6 million in debt funding in December of 2014 from Sterling National Bank.

From these experiences and analysis, this research note provides concrete advice to businesses interested in utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain for solutions unassociated with the value of bitcoin currency, such as Nasdaqs plan to facilitate the secure issuance and transfer of shares of privately held companies utilizing the blockchain.\n\nWhile there have been misguided statements suggesting that Bitcoin is the next Internet, this would be true only if the analogy were limited to a growth metric and not a technological comparison.

This Note evaluates the potential impact if new solutions with significant volume embed proof of ownership into the Bitcoin blockchain for long-term assets, such as stock holdings, property, or car titles. \n\nMarc Andreessen is correct that the Bitcoin trust algorithm is a fundamental breakthrough in computer science, but the construct of Bitcoin operations that incent Bitcoin miners was not part of that mathematical proof, said Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation, and author of report. Bitcoin embodies social science associated with the behavior of the miners, developers, and others; political science within the voting process that determine future enhancements; economic theory which establishes the value of bitcoin required to keep miners incented to mine for trust; and computer science that guides the software development, distribution, and management that keep this whole crazy Bitcoin ecosystem operational.

For now, at least, bitcoin is unlikely to keep banking regulators awake at night.\n\nThe Senate economics committee inquired into digital or \"virtual\" currencies last year after rulings by the Tax Office that bitcoin was an asset on which GST and capital gains tax should be paid.\n\nIn its final report, the inquiry has rejected that approach, recommending instead that bitcoin and other \"crypto-currencies\" be treated as forms of money for the purposes of tax law.\n\nHowever, it has stopped short of suggesting bitcoin be brought entirely into the fold of \"real\" currencies regulated by the Reserve Bank and accepted by your local bank.\n\n\"It's tempting for some people to overstate the power of bitcoin,\" says Dr Adrian Lee, who with fellow researchers made a submission to the inquiry. Dr Lee is a member of the finance discipline group in the Business School at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).\n\n\"But the entire pool of bitcoin is worth about $US10 billion [$14 billion], compared to the trillions of US dollars in existence. It's still in its infancy.\"\n\nBitcoin is a payment system invented in 2008 to allow peer-to-peer transactions – transactions between two people without a third party such as a bank being involved. Bitcoin does not exist as coins or notes but as \"virtual\" money.\n\nAs a currency, however, bitcoin has become known for big moves in value and that has attracted speculators hoping to capture big returns by buying bitcoin at a low point and selling it high.\n\nIn the two-year period studied by Dr Lee and researchers Associate Professor Dirk Baur and Dr Jimmy Hong, the value of a bitcoin rose from $5.28 to $388.55. But it wasn't a straight line. In that period it soared and dived – at one point reaching $1150 only to halve in value to $547 three weeks later.\n\nDr Lee and his researchers have been looking at whether bitcoin is a currency or a commodity, in a project sponsored by the SWIFT Institute, an international group that supports research into financial services.\n\nWhy does the difference matter? Because if bitcoin is mainly used as a currency to pay for goods and services it's a competitor to fiat or \"real\" currencies such as the US dollar. This means it could influence currency values and, ultimately, monetary policy in countries such as Australia. That makes it of interest to the Reserve Bank.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it's mainly used as an investment, it is competing with assets such as government bonds, shares and commodities, including gold. That means investment regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) will want to keep an eye on it.\n\nDr Lee and his researchers found that even though it was designed as a payment system, bitcoin appears to be used mainly as an investment.\n\nExamining transaction data from the public ledger on which the bitcoin network relies, the researchers estimated that \"currency users\" accounted for a small minority of bitcoin transactions – about 2.5 per cent. Those users keep very small balances.\n\nIn contrast, about a third of all available bitcoins are held by investors. \"There are very few users that use bitcoin purely as a medium of exchange, and the biggest group of users use it purely for investment,\" Dr Lee says.\n\nThe average transaction of a \"currency user\" is $130, compared to more than $18,000 for an \"active investor\" in bitcoin, according to the research.\n\nWhichever way bitcoin is used, says Miles Larbey, senior executive leader for financial literacy at ASIC's MoneySmart, people should remember that the exchange platforms on which you buy and sell virtual currencies are generally not regulated, which means that if the platform fails or is hacked you are not protected and have no statutory recourse.\n\n\"Just as your real wallet can be stolen by a thief, the contents of your digital wallet can be stolen by a computer hacker,\" Larbey says. \"You also have no protection against unauthorised or incorrect debits from your digital wallet.\"\n\nConsumer concerns aside, Dr Lee says that because the size of bitcoin investments and transactions is relatively small, the researchers don't see an immediate risk to overall financial or monetary stability.\n\n\"But if the acceptance of bitcoin or similar 'virtual' currencies increased significantly, on a global scale, that could change,\" he says. \"And, given bitcoin's global nature, and its independence from any central bank or multinational authority, regulatory oversight might be a challenge.\n\n\"Central banks and other regulators would be well advised to carefully monitor developments of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\"\n\nStories written and produced by the University of Technology, Sydney, for Brink, a publication distributed monthly in The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Bitcoin: currency or investment?","media-type":"News","source":"Tenterfield Star","published":"2015-09-14T14:00:00Z"},{"id":"54fd7a20-f8a1-4fb4-8cf4-e4b33de37f12","content":"“The next step in the evolution of money” \n \n“A de-centralized trust network” \n \n“Revolutionary Cryptocurrency” \n \n“Power to the people” \n \n“Lives without borders or limits” \n \nThe Currency of The Future… \n \nThe above headlines have been taken from various articles and literary publications since the creation of Bitcoin. It’s indicative of the acceptance and affinity shown by the global community, towards the arrival of a currency with global usage potential. \n \nWere there any realistic grounds to these sentiments and speculations? Are we still as optimistic about Bitcoin’s future? And more importantly, do we have any grounds to remain optimistic? \n \nSo, let us attempt to systematically attempt to answer these questions, with the least possible amount of dreary detail. \n Functions that Bitcoin needs, in order to be considered as “Money”  \nGenerally an instrument can be classified as money if it can serve as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. \n \nMedium of exchange would require that the currency be accepted as a payment method. This entails that a vendor accepts the currency as payment for his valued objects knowing that others would in turn accept the currency from him. \n \nOriginally, bitcoin exchange was limited to a small amount of online sites. The use of bitcoin has, however, significantly increased and spread to mainstream vendors. There are numerous practical drawbacks and advantages to the use on bitcoin as a medium of exchange, but it is accepted as such and therefore validly meets this requirement. \n \nA unit of account , bitcoin’s use as a unit of account is a direct derivative from the fact that it is used as a unit of exchange, i.e. because of its supply and demand in the exchange of goods it is viewed as a unit of account. Bitcoin’s market value is however extremely volatile which makes its suitability as a unit of account less than ideal. The volatility of the currency does not necessarily influence the speculative value therein, but it does have an effect on the quoted unit price that a vendor of a value object can display. To circumvent this problem, vendors usually display prices in traditional currency values and the bitcoin price is determined at the actual time of purchase. \n \nA store of value , bitcoin serves as a store of value for speculative investment. It is traded on a daily basis on most leading global markets. As previously mentioned, the market value of bitcoin is highly volatile which is attributable to the nature by which its value is determined. \n \nRegardless of the difficulties, whether they be practical or inherent to the currency’s nature, bitcoin does seem to meet the general requirements to be regarded as money. \n \nThe next logical step would be to determine how the value of bitcoin is measured and what motivates an increase or decrease in this value. \n Factors that traditionally influence the strength or weakness of a currency  \nIn the modern currency exchange market there are certain factors which influence a strong or weak currency. Briefly summarised the main factors are; Inflation, Interest Rates, Public debt, A Country’s Current Account, Economic and Political Stability and Employment Data . \n \nBitcoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency, allowing for the ability to send and receive money independent of any central authority or the need to go through an exchange, gateway or intermediary. It definitely does not take much to ascertain that factors currently used to determine traditional currency value would not assist in determining the value of bitcoin. The value of bitcoin is unaffected by the fiscal or monetary policies of any government and unlike a traditional currency it is also completely removed from the potential influences of economic and political practises and conditions. \n \nIf the factors used to establish price in the modern currency exchange market doesn’t impact the price value of bitcoin, what does then? In simple terms, only the most basic factor that has driven economics since the existence of our race, Supply & Demand . The increased acceptance of the currency among market participants and the higher demand for the currency by these participants is seen as the driving force behind the value of bitcoin. \n \nBesides the Supply & Demand for the currency, there are a few other factors which have shown a definitive impact on the value of bitcoin. \n \nEconomic crisis , due to distrust or uncertainty in the value or future of a certain currency investors have in the past opted to move their investments to bitcoin to avoid depreciation. This results in a significant inflow of cash into bitcoin and an increased bitcoin value. A recent example of this can be found in Europe due to the uncertainty surrounding Greece and their further use of the euro currency. \n \nMedia exposure , media hype and more people partaking in bitcoin exchange has significantly contributed the value swell of the bitcoin currency. \n \nHoarding , as with any other currency, many holders of bitcoin hoard their bitcoin which reduces the supply and in turn increases the exchange price. An increased exchange price in most cases leads to increased media exposure which further increases the market’s participation and places further buying pressure on the market. \n \nGovernment interventio n , growing fear of governmental interference could lead to a declining investment in bitcoin by the market. Some of the main advantages of bitcoin are found in the fact that it is decentralised and for the most part removed from governmental influence. There has of late been certain indication that global governments are considering greater regulation of the currency. \n \nSo there we have it, right? Standard evaluation points to bitcoin’s status as the currency of the future. It meets the basic requirements and all the new requirements expected by the modern consumer. It has immense global potential. \n \nAnd yet, there are certain key developments which could derail the bitcoin revolution. So before you convert your net worth to holdings in bitcoin, there are a few developments that require some close monitoring over the coming months and years. In order for bitcoin to establish itself as an emerging global currency, it will have to overcome these main teething issues. \n \nTrust and volatility , as stated before, bitcoin is arguably one of the most volatile instruments traded on the global market. The price volatility increases distrust among many users and investors. Volatility is further exaggerated by events such as exchange meltdowns, operational failures and security breaches. The recent “flash crash” has also further added to the speculation around the currency’s ability to enter mainstream commerce. \n \nSome experts have argued that local governments can play a role in stabilising the price volatility through methods such as technology regulation and clampdowns on fraudulent bitcoin transacting. I for one believe that increased regulation is not the fix to this problem. Increased regulatory involvement could lead to a decrease in the general public’s interest and the overall allure of the currency. \n \nIn my opinion the volatility and trust issues can be addressed by educating the market on the technology that underlies bitcoin. The innovation can’t be ignored and the actual level of security, value and growth that can be accomplished once bitcoin outgrows its infancy, is the message that needs to be cemented into market participants’ understanding. \n \nBlock size capacity and potential forking , for the past months bitcoin developers have been debating the need to increase the block size. An increased block size would allow for a higher number in transaction capability at any given moment. Although the general consensus seems to be in favour of an increased block size, key developers are at odds as to the timeframe in which such an increase should be implemented. \n \nThe main concern for the bitcoin community in this regard is the potential prospect of a “fork”, which would mean a situation where bitcoin divides into two competing versions. The “fork” currently rumoured is brought about between Bitcoin Core advocates and the developers responsible for the release of Bitcoin XT. \n \nThe circulating rumours have done no favours for bitcoin in terms of increasing stability and trust in the currency. In order for the developers of bitcoin XT to succeed in increasing the block size it will require an adoption by 75% of users by January 2016. Thus far it is estimated that approximately 7.7% of users have adopted XT. The adoption of XT does look highly unlikely within this given timeframe. \n \nCore and XT are however compatible and both currently exist in the same blockchain. In the long term, even if the XT version is not adopted by the specified date, the debate regarding an increased block size will continue. This, as well as previously mentioned factors, will continue to undermine bitcoin stability and trust. \n \nIn summary, bitcoin has proven that it is in fact the technology on which it is built which should be viewed as the true value of the currency. There are numerous issues found in the inherent nature of bitcoin which will be addressed over time and there is no reason to doubt that they will be addressed at some point. Whether it is in the current version that we’ve gotten to know and love, or in a version yet to be created or adopted, remains to be seen. \n \nOnce globally adopted and accepted, the potential benefits of the currency are endless. Taking all into account I remain positive that bitcoin will reach its potential, its volatility will stabilise and the broader commerce markets’ trust in the currency will improve, but until such time the only certainty is that we’re in for a bumpy ride … \n \nWanted for everything \n \nYours truly, \n \nMacavity \n \nThe post Bitcoin: Does the “Currency of the Future” tag still hold true? appeared first on Deep Dot Web .","title":"Bitcoin: Does the “Currency of the Future” tag still hold true?","media-type":"Blog","source":"Deep Dot Web","published":"2015-09-27T07:50:33Z"},{"id":"683346b1-99a0-440c-8a4d-3e0106786514","content":"Bitcoin exchange CEX.IO is pleased to announce lower fees for payment card deposits in USD and EUR to 3.5% + $0.25/€0.20 respectively.

In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. \n\nAs an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. \n\nWebmasters and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a \"spider\" to \"crawl\" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed. The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server, where a second program, known as an indexer, extracts various information about the page, such as the words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for specific words, and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. \n\nHonolulu, Hawaii Reputation Management Guru http://www.G3-Development.co/ (Founder, Adam Green) Awarded \"Best-of-the-State\" (May 2015) for Best Analytics by Utah Technology Ninja\n\nThe Real Reasons Why To Use Social Media: \n\n1. If ones business can't be found — they are not engaging with the \"True Market.\" \n\n2. Social Media (YouTube) is 64% more effective — than traditional advertising. \n\n3. Ones \"True Competition\" — is guaranteed to be engaged in Social Media. \n\n4. One will find customers — 15 times faster with Social Media. \n\n5. One can reach the \"True Market\" — by simply engaging the right people. \n\n6. By ignoring this Social Media Market, they are not creating opportunities – while the competition is. \n\n7. Social Media saves massive amounts of time— if one uses it right. \n\nSite owners started to recognize the value of having their sites highly ranked and visible in search engine results, creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase \"search engine optimization\" probably came into use in 1997. The first documented use of the term Search Engine Optimization was John Audette and his company Multimedia Marketing Group as documented by a web page from the MMG site from August, 1997. \n\nEarly versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag, or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using meta data to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches. Web content providers also manipulated a number of attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.\n\nAbout G3 Development \n\nG3 Development is set out to proactively serve the business community by providing solutions in entrepreneurialism, business development, social media and venture capitalism.\n\nTo provide leadership in establishing strength with our client's international businesses, being built on a foundation of innovation, advocacy, technology and business integrity\n\nhttp://www.g3-development.co/\n\n877-229-9183\n\nFor more information on this press release visit: http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/honolulu-hawaii-reputation-management-guru-wwwg3-developmentco-founder-adam-green-awarded-best-of-the-state-may-2015-for-best-analytics-by-utah-technology-ninja-623260.htm\n\nAdam Green\n\nG3 Development\n\nTelephone: 801-809-7766Email: Web: http://www.g3-development.co","title":"Honolulu, Hawaii Reputation Management Guru www.G3-Development.co (Founder, Adam Green) Awarded \"Best-of-the-State\" (May 2015) for Best Analytics by Utah Technology Ninja","media-type":"News","source":"Digital Journal","published":"2015-09-18T14:48:02Z"},{"id":"70e7ecac-ccb3-4e73-b890-e1d44b7ad834","content":") - The independent authority on internet marketing, topseos.com, has named Foxtail Marketing  the best search engine optimization agency for the month of September 2015.

Thanks for visiting!\n5avg.rating\r37 votes.\rDo you find it challenging to get site visitors? You may need to do some search engine optimization. Many people do not understand how search engines rank websites when a search is completed. Continue reading to learn more about this for the sake of your website. One of the most important elements of the optimized site is appropriate keyword density. Keywords should total 20% or less of the entire article. It is important to use a name that is rich in keywords for your domain. This can help make it easier for people to find your website. Ads do not give you all of your visitors; some visitors get to your site by looking for products that you might have. You will want to find out how long they have been in the business. Prior to making any decisions, understand the risks that are involved. Anchor Text When creating anchor text for your website, simply using “click here” or other generic terms is not enough. A common example of poor anchor text is “click here”. This anchor text contributes nothing to your search rank. Utilizing the correct keywords in your anchor text will not go unnoticed by those search engine spiders. Become an expert in your field. Being an expert in your field can prove lucrative in marketing your internet business. Design your website around a certain niche, and use SEO techniques to drive those potential customers to your site so they can buy your products and services. Create a product line that meets customers’ preferences, rather than selling merchandise that is simply what you might assume is what they want to buy. Blogs are a great way to add fresh SEO content to your site. Since search engines like highly-structured websites and new content, blogs often rank high on them. Getting links to your site out there is essential for your search ranking. Have a website, particularly one that is perceived as positive and useful by most people, post a link to yours; for instance, a site from a non-profit organization can back-link to you. Being linked up to reliable sources can help raise your search rankings. If your site contains information that is useful to readers, reputable websites will want to link to it. Create content that these organizations will find useful and worthy. While you can do a link exchange with others, it’s a good idea to focus on article exchanges with other website owners in order to raise your site in search engine rankings. Post an article from another site on your own and they will do the same on theirs, both of which include a link back to the other site. It is more efficient than exchanging links, and a win/win for both site owners. Duplicate content will subject you to spam filters of the search engines. You may be using duplicated content and aren’t even aware of it. Using the same description is easy, but could be flagged as spam. Search Engine You might think search engine optimization could not be that effective, but it is for sure. So keep the above tips in mind as you work to optimize your search engine ratings.

As early as this fall, the company hopes to get Chinese government approval to distribute a special China version of its Google Play mobile app store for Android smartphones in the country, said people familiar with the plan. Google has extensive plans for how it will architect and run the store locally and has partnerships in place with specific Chinese companies to do so. Google is prepping a special China app store for Android devices and extending its Android Wear software for wearable devices there. The moves will re-establish Google as an Internet services provider in mainland China that stores user data locally and complies with government censorship requirements.

My suggestion before was for Microsoft (MSFT) to immediately plug this hole in the Project Astoria kit. Well, Microsoft has indeed fixed this bug/exploit because it is necessary to protect its Lumia and app store business. \n \nThe geeks who could run Android apps were able to use Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) Play Store for in-app purchases on cheap Windows 10-enabled hardware like the sub-$100 Lumia 435.

So for the DYWA to open the door for them, I think the government is moving in the right direction, by giving our youth many chances to develop their football careers,” said Laumatia. \n  \nAccording to Ethan Lake, the American Samoa Sports Commissioner, the primary purpose for this program is to provide another avenue of opportunity for our high school graduates to make it to an off island college or university through sports, by focusing on their academics at a local institute while also continuing and improving on their personal athletics. \n  \nThis program is also for anyone who just wants to continue playing football. \n  \nThose who will be eligible under this program are any high school football players who have graduated, who are attending any one of the local colleges, including ASCC, Remington, Argosy or any other online university. \n  \nRegistration for the program began last Monday, August 31 and will close on Thursday, October 15, 2015. \n  \nThe DYWA is looking for 108 football players to register in the program, in order to fill three football teams of 36 players per team to start off the program. \n  \nSo far, close to 50 football players have already been registered since Monday this week, and the DYWA is encouraging more players to register. \n  \nA brief get-together with DYWA and football players interested in this program occurred on Monday this week, where DYWA officials explained the program to those present. \n    \n[photo: Tony Gasu]","title":"PREP  FOOTBALL LEAGUE OPENS ANOTHER OP FOR OUR ATHLETES THROUGH DYWA","media-type":"News","source":"SamoaNews.com","published":"2015-09-06T20:16:37Z"},{"id":"44ea19af-3e4a-47ec-b81c-91a735682ebe","content":"Football Season \n \r\n            \r\n\r \nCBS SPORTS RADIO is unveiling its weekend schedule changes for the football season this SATURDAY (8/5). \n\r\n\r \nAmong the changes, RICH ACKERMAN will host EYE ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL on SATURDAYS noon-8p (ET); EYE ON FANTASY FOOTBALL with CBSSports.com senior fantasy football writers ADAM AIZER, DAVE RICHARD and JAMEY EISENBERG rotating as hosts will air on SATURDAY evenings 10p-midnight (ET) from NEW YORK and FORT LAUDERDALE and will be carried on stations including CBS RADIO Sports WFAN-A-F/NEW YORK, WSCR-A (670 THE SCORE)/CHICAGO, and WQAM-A/MIAMI. \n\r\n\r \nCBS SPORTS RADIO weeknight host DAMON AMENDOLARA will host SUNDAY MORNING FOOTBALL 9-11a (ET) SUNDAYS, starting SEPTEMBER 13th, and CBSSPORTS.COM's FANTASY FOOTBALL TODAY will be simulcast on the network SUNDAYS 11a-noon.   ACKERMAN will then host EYE ON FOOTBALL on SUNDAYS noon-8p, also beginning SEPTEMBER 13th. \n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n\r \n« see more Net News","title":"CBS Sports Radio Sets Football Season Weekend Schedule","media-type":"News","source":"AllAccess.com","published":"2015-09-01T18:36:04Z"},{"id":"8828b20c-bb0a-4eec-acc1-c468a33e289b","content":"Intramural Flag Football – Thursdays, 2:25 – 4:30\n\n\n\nLanier After-School Intramural Sports will run a Coed Flag Football League this Fall on Thursdays.

Technology has increased our ability to communicate with each other. The world has gone wireless and the average human being today carries in his or her pocket more communication potential than that possessed by any mid-Twentieth Century government office.\n\nIt is not surprising that this vast network of communication has a great deal of influence on our children. The continuous adoption of new technologies has become a social game-changer. Lifestyles, and modes of social interaction are in a constant state of flux. These new developments also cause a number of new problems, not the least of which is a loss of social skills. Social skills are an art form. An analogy can be made to the art of painting. At one time, it was quite beneficial to be able to paint a recognizable reproduction of a real-life scene. Then along comes the camera, making it possible to reproduce an image without having to pick up a brush. The camera reduced the necessity of realistic painting, and also had a great deal of influence on the kind of image which is created.\n\nWhile we have, in our present society, a greater ability to communicate than at any time in the past, the quality of that communication has dropped drastically. The ability to engage in coherent and intelligent debate has almost completely vanished. Political candidates now debate in sound bites because that’s what the technology facilitates. Disagreements are now often reduced to shouting matches, both on and off the Internet.\n\nTechnology has also given rise to a new form of harassment called cyber bullying. For young people, online social networks have become an important part of gaining social acceptance. Children are considered outcasts if they don’t have a Facebook page. In fact, the need for communication over the Internet is so great that children often use it as an argument against their parents attempts to restrict Internet access.\n\nWhen a universal increase in the ability to communicate is coupled with a lowering of the quality of communication, it results in an inevitable increase in rudeness and cruelty. Bullying is often the result.\n\nBecause of this, parents should be informed of the dangers as well as the advantages of the Internet.\n\nOne of the big problems with cyber bullying is that it is not direct and face to face. Anyone with a computer can make rude, viscous or denigrating remarks against another person without fear of physical reprisal. While the anonymity of the Internet may give power to the powerless, it also gives power to the crude and the ruthless.\n\nCyber bullying has become a very serious problem that has already resulted in more than one death by suicide. Cyber bullying is most severe among teenage girls, although boys are sometimes victims or the bullies.\n\nThe lack of face-to-face contact gives courage to bullies and makes them feel invincible. Because of this, they may make a far more serious assault than they would if they had to physically confront their victim.\n\nOne of the dangers of cyber bullying is that children rarely report it to their parents when it happens. This is primarily due to fears that parents will restrict internet access, overreact, under-react, or simply not understand.\n\nSince your child may not reveal when he or she is being bullied, it is very important to understand and look for the signs of cyber bullying. Here is what you should look for:\n\nSudden withdrawal from online communication\nYour child blocks or clears the screen or closes the browser when you enter the room. The same applies if your child closes or quickly puts away his phone.\nWithdrawal from friends or an unwillingness to participate in social activities with his or her peers.\nA rapid change in mood after being online or using a cell phone.\nYour child suddenly changes his circle of friends.\nYour child is withdrawn, sad or agitated for no apparent reason.\nHere’s what you can do about cyber bullying.\n\nMaintain communication with your children. Don’t lecture or fuss, just let them know that you are willing to listen and that they can come to you if they have a problem. They are not alone.\nIf they have done something over which they are embarrassed, such as sending an inappropriate picture of themselves to someone else, or they are embarrassed by the bullying itself, let them know that you won’t punish them, you are simply concerned for their safety.\nTake action. Let the school or the authorities know what is happening. Many law enforcement agencies now have special task groups who investigate incidents of cyber bullying.\nBe particularly vigilant if your child has a developmental disorder. Children with disorders such as ADHD, ODD, and Autism are more likely to be bullied and to be bullies. They tend to act impulsively and don’t always understand the subtleties of social interaction.\nAnd finally, stay computer literate. Learn the language of social media. You can find out a lot at netlingo.com. By learning about social media, you open up the communication lines between yourself and your child, because you have knowledge of social media in common. A parent who knows social media is one of the best defenses against cyber bullying.\n\n\n\nAuthor Bio: Dr. Tali Shenfield is a Child Psychologist and a Clinical Director of Richmond Hill Psychology Center.

This is significantly higher than in 2013, when 47% of Facebook users and 53% of Twitter users said they used those platforms for news. \n \nGoogle, with its search engine and Google News, is another tech company that has successfully moved into the news business. \n \nLarge media companies have been slow to react to these digital trends. Some legacy news organisations, such as the New York Times and National Geographic , recently started to deliver content directly to Facebook. Others, including the Financial Times in the UK, La Stampa in Italy and El Pais in Spain, have formed the “Digital News Initiative” in collaboration with Google. \n \nIs this a pact with the devil? It is too early to provide a final answer, but new worry lines have appeared in the faces of notorious media pessimists, making them look older than ever. \n \nCertainly there is an acute danger that the once strong and at least half-way independent media dinosaurs – the traditional newspaper publishing houses – will end up in the arms of the “teenage giants” (as Natascha Just, a media researcher from the University of Zurich, describes Amazon, Facebook, Google & Co). \n \nHowever, we also know that those who consume news mainly via social networks are spinning themselves into a cocoon – ending up in a “filter bubble“ ( Eli Pariser ).  Allowing other users, Facebook friends and algorithms, to decide which bits of reality they can see. \n \nIn the long run this will also influence which media will be seen by the public and, crucially, how different media brands will be perceived. \n \nThe Pew Research Centre also provides interesting new findings on trust .  A team of researchers, directed by Amy Mitchell, analysed the credibility of well-known US media brands among three age groups: “Millenials” (aged 18-33 years), “Generation X“ (34-49) and the “Baby Boomers“ (over 50). A surprising result is that credibility is about the same across the generations. \n \nLess surprising is how low that credibility is. \n \nAmong the media which, according to Mitchell’s study, enjoy “more trust than mistrust” across the three generations is Google News – besides the usual suspects (including New York Times, Washington Post , the TV-networks ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and BBC). \n \nAmericans across all three age groups say they distrust Buzzfeed, as well as the talk show hosted by the populist right-wing radio star Rush Limbaugh. \n \nThe very way the research question was formulated – survey participants were asked whether they trust or distrust one media brand more than others – points to the historic lows of journalistic credibility which have been reached after decades of decay, unfortunately not only in the US. \n \nRealistically it can be assumed that a loss of credibility is actually a loss of trust and this inevitably translates to a declining willingness to pay for journalistic products. \n \nHow is it possible that a profession which, by definition, has to deploy its antennae to scent out and hype every new trend, could have overlooked the obvious warning signs for such a long time? \n \nMany journalists still seem to ignore the evidence that their own house is burning , despite the attacks against the mainstream media on the net and despite the fact that not only PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) followers are chanting “lying press” in the streets. \n \nThe collective burying of heads in the sand might be only explicable with support from social psychology and behavioural economics: perhaps journalists themselves are operating in a “filter bubble” – possibly, because most newsrooms don’t cover media and journalism, and because many journalists continue to cultivate their prejudices against the researchers in the ivory tower. \n \n  \n \nA shorter version of this text has been published in German, in Schweizer Journalist Nr. 8+9/2015.

After all, cyberbullying can happen around the clock, it's relentless, and it's driven by crowd behaviour - in fact, you can consider it a horrible manifestation of crowd-sourcing. The survey of 4720 teenagers around the world found that people - particularly young people - can find it tough to show support for friends who are being cyberbullied, given that they're afraid of being bullied themselves or simply struggle to find the right words. Vodafone commissioned the survey from internet-based market research firm YouGov. 18% of the teens surveyed - nearly one in five - reported that they've been cyberbullied. Of that group, 18% experienced suicidal thoughts. More than half of teens said that they consider cyberbullying to be worse than face-to-face bullying, and 43% consider it it to be a bigger problem for young people than drug abuse. More of the findings: 41% said cyberbullying made them feel depressed, and 41% said it made them feel helpless 26% felt \"completely alone\" 21% stayed away from school 25% closed down their social media accounts 38% said they didn't tell their parents or guardians, as they felt ashamed (32%), scared their parents would get involved (40%), or worried what their parents might do (36%). Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and the psychologist adviser on the Pixar film Inside Out, said, in a video put out in conjunction with the survey release, that research has shown how friend-to-friend support is one of the most successful ways of preventing and addressing cyberbullying. But again, young people are often hampered by fear of being targeted, and they simply don't know what to say. Of those surveyed, 43% said they'd find it hard to support a friend who'd been bullied on social media, as they \"could not find the right words\" to show support. They do know how to text, though. Keltner said that emojis can help to tell victims of cyberbullying that they're not alone. 72% of teens said they'd be likely to use an emoji to express compassion or support for friends being cyberbullied. Vodafone's on it. The UK-based telecom on Tuesday came out with a new set of emojis, vetted by the teenage survey respondents, to show compassion and support. The idea was suggested to the company by anti-bullying ambassador Monica Lewinsky. Of the teens' two favourite sets of emojis, one shows hands silhouetted in an embrace against a heart image. The other set shows two hands, of different colours, clasping each other. The images are part of a donation campaign from Vodafone Foundation, which is the telecom's philanthropic arm. The foundation also announced that it will help raise funds for anti-bullying NGOs by donating 10p (14 cents) for every Twitter retweet or public Facebook like of Vodafone’s image of what it's calling the #BeStrong emojis, for a total donation of up to £100,000 (€137,000, $152,525). Vodafone is also talking to the major emoji app and social media platforms with regards to featuring the emojis on their platforms in the near future. Can a simple emoji actually make a difference to somebody who's being cyberbullied? An emoji is just a whisper: the bare minimum amount of contact you can make with somebody. In the best of all possible worlds, we'd all stand up for our friends when they're being bullied. We'd intervene, and we'd give full voice in compassion and support. But in the world we actually live in, an emoji is a much louder, better alternative to the response cyberbullying victims too often get. Too often, all they hear is silence. Bring on the support emojis.

He said the data could have implications for the way brands and even politicians communicate on-line. \n\n\"Not only is Harry Styles one of the most popular celebs on Twitter with over 24 million followers but is also the most upbeat in terms of mood,\" said Mr Johnston. \n\n\"Styles has become a global brand and like any brand is conscious how he communicates online. The study provides a new dimension by looking at the impact of specific emotions that people communicate on platforms like Twitter. \n\n\"As part of the research we've identified that those celebrities that express strong emotions like joy or rage on Twitter are more likely to receive retweets or favourites. We found that the strength of each emotion expressed by a celebrity - known as their 'activation levels' - provides a good indicator as to how often they will be retweeted.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nFootball stars Cristiano Ronaldo (7) and Wayne Rooney (15), the X-Factor's Simon Cowell (18), the Dalai Lama (13) and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (14) are also among the top 20. \n\nUS singer Chris Brown was the least happy, according to the survey. \n\nThe research is part of a campaign by Adoreboard aimed at increasing people's awareness of how they communicate emotions in written text ranging from e-mails to press releases. \n\nGary McKeown, an expert in communication and emotions at the School of Psychology at Queen's, said: \"Humans are constantly trying to align themselves to others they value in their social group and we pay particular interest to emotions and feelings of others.

Many physicians doubted the existence of depression in children because they believed children lacked the mature psychologic and cognitive structure to experience such problems. Depression in children has always been a difficult topic for society, and perhaps even healthcare professionals, to comprehend. Today, however, it is a stark reality with the fastest rate of increase in depression among young people; research by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) shows that 80,000 children in the UK are estimated to suffer from severe depression, including 8,000 below the age of 10.\n\nI have noticed a significant rise in the number of children, as young as six, referred to our psychology and counselling centres suffering from depression and anxiety. It is difficult to pinpoint if this upward trend of referrals is a result of an increase in mental distress due to societal pressures, or a result of other factors such as lack of provision within the health service, or factors unique to the individual such as parents splitting up. \n\nOn the flip side of the coin, young children are often referred unfairly due to parents’ anxieties and worries rather than the seriousness of the difficulties being experienced by the child. Parents often make up their own diagnosis and refer their child to therapy when there isn’t really a serious problem. Therapists then spend time reassuring the parent that what they are seeing is normal developmental processes. Other elements may therefore be at play here and are subsequently increasing referral rates; health professionals need to be aware and cautious of this.\n\nSocial pressures and expectations are fuelling the rise of mental health problems in children. Childhood seems to be more stressful than ever due to a greater emphasis on exams and grades, the rise of social media and cyberbullying, and the media’s portrayal of body image. I have seen an increase in young clients, especially girls, with emotional problems often caused by increased pressure in the media and advertising to achieve an unrealistic body image, further perpetuated by social media. Girls as young as six are dieting and the number of schoolchildren at risk of emotional problems has risen sharply according to the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\nThe number of children playing outdoors with friends after school has rapidly declined over the last decade as they spend more time on computers and social media. Young people are bombarded with images and advice from celebrities on how to achieve the “perfect body”. These pressures often cause young people to develop low self-esteem which can lead to depression. According to Young Minds, one in 10 children and young people aged 5 - 16 suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder –around three children in every class.\n\nSo what can health professionals do to tackle this worrying rise? There needs to be more focus on tackling childhood depression and greater awareness is a good starting point. I welcome Nice’s recent guidelines calling on healthcare professionals, teachers, and other community teams working directly with children to be trained to detect the signs of depression and to provide child-friendly information and advice.\n\nDepression can be difficult to diagnose, especially in children, as it is often mistaken for behavioural or developmental issues and vice versa. As well as showing many of the same symptoms of adult depression, some symptoms of depression in children are: a downward trend in performance at school, loss of energy and extreme tiredness, agitation and restlessness, and a feeling of worthlessness. Greater expertise is needed to spot these signs and early intervention will allow quicker access to specialist services and hopefully reduce the potential risk of suicide. According to ChildLine, 34,517 counselling sessions were held in 2013/14 with children who talked about suicidal thoughts – a 117% increase since 2010/11.\n\nThe World Health Organisation predicts that by 2030, more people will be affected by depression than any other health problem (pdf). If this is the case, healthcare professionals need to start tackling the roots of depression in childhood, fully support children and recognise that their mental health is something of great value and importance, an area we have badly neglected in the past. However, at the same time mental health professionals need to exercise caution. More research is needed to understand the factors causing the rise in referrals and ensure children are not being referred or diagnosed unreasonably because of commercial pressures or anxious parents.\n\nJoin our network to read more pieces like this.

The best way is to make sure you blend computer-based learning with print.\"\n\nA 2013 study from Norwegian academics at Stavanger University found that reading narrative texts on a computer screen led to poorer reading comprehension than reading the same texts on paper.\n\nThe same study also found that page scrolling through large slabs of texts on a screen lacked the natural markers that allowed for reading comprehension. \n\nResearchers from the University of Karlstad in Sweden found in 2005 that reading on screen drained more of students' mental resources, making remembering the text more challenging. \n\nOther studies in the Journal of Experimental Psychology have found that the way people approach digital and printed texts is fundamentally different. The majority of people engage with printed texts in a way that is more geared towards learning. \n\nProfessor Finger said that in the age of Facebook these differences have only been exacerbated. \n\nNew research commissioned by Canon and conducted by Galaxy found that, out of the 500 students surveyed, 52 per cent of them cited the temptation to check social media as a key challenge when focusing on exams.\n\n\"You can't assume that students studying for hours clicking through many screens are actually engaging in learning,\" Professor Finger said. \"They might be playing games, or online gambling. You never know.\" \n\nProfessor Finger urged parents to encourage their children to use handwritten notes as they did when they were studying for their own exams decades ago. \n\n\"The handwritten notes of a successful student look like a dog's gotten into it,\" he said. \"Sometimes we overlook good old-fashioned study because of new technology. There is a tendency to say 'we've always done it this way, it's no good any more'. We can't just discard old study habits. \n\n\"We have to get the blend right.\"","title":"HSC students warned of computer curse","media-type":"News","source":"Sydney Morning Herald","published":"2015-09-26T14:40:37Z"},{"id":"073ffab2-c0c3-4842-94a0-64e43739039e","content":"Ronaldo showed his optimism towards Chinese soccer market, and hoped his understanding of soccer could help China improve its soccer level.  \n \nFormer Brazil star Ronaldo \n \nChina has turned to Former Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo to change its football fortunes. The former World Cup winner in 2002,  has announced that he will open 30 soccer schools in China and train Chinese youngsters with his special method. When attending the opening ceremony of his soccer school in Campinas of Sao Paulo state, Ronaldo showed his optimism towards the Chinese soccer market, and hoped his understanding of soccer could help China improve its soccer level. \n \n“Besides business factor, the major reason for me to open soccer school in China is because there are lots of soccer fans and players in the country, and Chinese government and civil organization also focus on soccer development. I hope my method of soccer training could help develop Chinese soccer,” Ronaldo told Xinhua news agency. \n \n“I think Chinese soccer has the mass base and determination, but it may still lack the proper concept and training method,” Ronaldo added. According to statistics released by Germany’s Transfer Market, the Chinese Super League (CSL) spent a record 108 million euros to buy players and coaches on the 2014-15 transfer market. \n \nThe Chinese league, which has been professional for only 20 years, stands second to only the English Premier League in terms of the money spent on transfers, topping most of the top-flight leagues around the world. Last week, CSL sold its broadcasting rights for 8 billion yuan for the five years in 2016-20. \n \nThe Chinese government announced an ambitious soccer reform plan earlier this year, which includes the women’s team’s return to the world top class as a mid—term goal, and the men’s side joining the world leading powers in the long run. Bidding to host the World Cup is also listed as a long—term goal. \n \nDespite the investment and reform plan, China has been bothered by the lowly performance of the national sides. The men’s team just qualified for one World Cup final, in 2002. Meanwhile, the women’s side is struggling to recreate their glory as the 1999 World Cup runners—up. \n \nCarlos Wizard Martins, president of Ronaldo soccer academy, believed with the help of Ronaldo soccer academy, China could make progress on the World Cup stage.","title":"China turns to Ronaldo for football glory, former Brazilian star to open schools in China","media-type":"News","source":"Tehelka","published":"2015-09-29T05:56:44Z"},{"id":"8df0d67f-fef3-415c-b6da-8966eff668f2","content":"Listen to the latest episode of World Soccer Talk Radio featuring an interview with Gaz Drinkwater, aka Radio Gaz, from the popular YouTube channel, FullTime Devils . \n \nDuring the interview, Gaz shares his thoughts about Manchester United’s recent form and looks ahead to this Sunday’s all-important game away at Southampton, as well as talking about how FullTime Devils got started and what it’s like working on the YouTube channel.

It’s another case for establishing a men’s program here at UH. \n      \nTC : What is the process and timeline from now until the theoretical establishment of a program? \n \nHL : It’s a process of getting people to understand the potential that a men’s soccer program here at UH possesses. I’ve presented to the SGA, and it was received with great acclaim. On Oct. 14, I will be presenting to the Athletics Advisory Board. I eventually plan to present to our President and the Board of Regents. The overall timeline of establishing a program is hard to forecast. I personally would be content with the program being established within three years. It’s hard to predict all of the hurdles. Nonetheless, I’m very passionate about the endeavor and prepared with the right information. \n \nTC : What made you want to push for the University to have a men’s soccer program? \n \nHL : There are thousands of kids playing soccer here in the state of Texas that don’t have many options to play college at the highest level. Currently, Southern Methodist University, Houston Baptist University and the University of Texas-Pan American are the only schools to field a men’s Division I team. There are zero major public universities that have men’s soccer. It’s baffling and sad. There is too much talent that either leaves the state or drops the sport to attend a public university. \n \nTC : What is your goal for this University with men’s soccer? \n \nHL :  The ultimate goal is for the potential of a program to come to fruition. I want UH to be among the elite in NCAA men’s soccer. I want UH to be recognized as a trailblazer for the other large public universities to add men’s soccer programs. \n \nTC : What benefits would a men’s program offer UH? \n \nHL : For starters, it would cater to the student population here at UH. We are the second-most diverse university in the nation. Soccer is a global sport. Our University would have strong leverage on some of the best soccer players in the nation. Men’s soccer would also allow us to reach out and expand on a market that is not saturated by the University of Texas, Texas A&M University and others.. \n \nTC : Do you think soccer has a chance to be a ‘Top-4’ collegiate sport? \n \nHL :  College soccer is growing steadily and significantly. According to Winthrop Intelligence, a database resource for athletic directors to increase revenue and save money, athletic directors are devoting more and more resources towards the development of their soccer programs. Soccer is the only sport outside of football and basketball that shows promise at becoming self-sustaining. In fact, only 43 percent of all college football programs break even. \n \nTC : What kind of numbers have you found that backup your claim about soccer being the next big thing? \n \nHL : When you consider the global landscape of sports, soccer is already the biggest thing there is. It’s one of the only sports that was imported to the United States. You can have a kid in a third world country play the same sport as a kid in a first world country. College soccer will grow subsequent with the professional game and the interest at the grass root levels of the sport. Here are two facts: there are more kids playing soccer than any other sport in the country. The U.S. has more youth soccer players than any other World Cup contender. \n \nTC : What is the biggest obstacle facing you going forward? \n \nHL : The biggest obstacle is convincing the business-savvy individuals of the athletic department that men’s soccer is worth the investment. \n \nTC : What is your pitch for why we need a program? \n \nHL : My pitch is simple. College soccer will not stop growing. The Texas universities are falling behind on this opportunity. We can either be a leader or a follower. \n \nTC : Do you think soccer at UH is something that has a chance to transcend just athletics? \n \nHL : I say this with all due respect to the other athletic programs here at UH: If a men’s soccer program were established, we would be a national championship contender within five years. Our attendance would rival the highest national average. Houston has one of the best youth soccer communities in the country. The community fosters vast amounts of soccer talent every year. The most important aspect to consider is that there is no competition with what our University has to offer. \n \nTC : If you had a chance to talk directly to President Renu Khator and Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics Hunter Yurachek, what is one thing you would tell them to change their mind? \n \nHL : We always talk about gaining ground on the other universities in Texas. Men’s soccer offers an opportunity to be a leader. \n \n[email protected] \n \n Related  \n \nTags:  Men's Soccer","title":"Student sees men’s soccer as UH’s next great endeavor","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Cougar","published":"2015-09-30T10:00:27Z"},{"id":"e30f41a4-6a27-42e9-b288-9ef87999c38f","content":"On the latest episode of Soccer Morning, Jason Davis features an interview with David Cartlidge. \n \nJason kicks off today’s show with David Cartlidge (beIN SPORTS) as they look back at the latest headlines & results coming out of Spain. \n \nListen to the episode above or  here . \n \nYou can listen to Soccer Morning live via the World Soccer Talk LIVE page at  www.worldsoccertalk.com/live . \n \nDuring the show, you can tweet your questions or observations live to @soccermorning Or better yet, you can call in with your questions or comments by dialing 646-832-3909. \n On-demand video stream  \n\n \nRead more about the  World Soccer Talk and Soccer Morning  partnership. \n \nSo, how can you watch or listen to the show?
